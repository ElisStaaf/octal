# Octal
OCTOL: A subpar LOC counter, written in Go. But I mean, it works! I'm going to walk you trough
the installation and usages, but firstly, the most important thing:

## Why did I name it Octal?
Octal is a numeral system, it's not a programming concept. Octal also has a strong connection to the
number *eight*. But like, what??? This project doesn't have any connection to the number *eight*???
Wait, it does! That's how many times i asked myself why I'm really doing this!!! Yes! That must be it!
